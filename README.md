# Angular Tour Of Heroes

Following the 'Tour Of Heroes' official Angular tutorial we develop an application that:

- Gets a list of heroes
- Displays the heroes in a list
- Edits a selected hero's details
- Navigates between different views of heroic data

Through this tutorial we can gain confidence developing Angular projects by learning:

- Use Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data.
- Create Angular components to display hero details and show an array of heroes.
- Use one-way data binding for read-only data.
- Add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding.
- Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.
- Enable users to select a hero from a list and edit that hero in the details view.
- Format data with pipes.
- Create a shared service to assemble the heroes.
- Use routing to navigate among different views and their components.
